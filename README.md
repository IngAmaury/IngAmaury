<h1 align="center"> Hi, I´m Amaury Santiago Horta 👋 </h1>

 <h3 align="center"> I'm a Bionics Engeneeering, currently studying the last semester of Master's degree in Advanced Technology with focus on software development. Interested in building scalable Full Stack applications that integrate Deep Learning models and real-time signal processing. Experience transforming complex data into user-centered products. </h3>
 
## 🗃️ Projects
- 💳 CreditSim (React + FastAPI) [See➡️](https://github.com/IngAmaury/CreditSim)
> A full-stack credit/loan simulator that generates a French-system monthly amortization schedule, persists each simulation in SQLite, and triggers a mock risk audit asynchronously (non-blocking).
- 🧩 Users Microservice [See➡️](https://github.com/IngAmaury/UsersMicroservice)
> A Node.js/Express microservice built with OOP + Singleton, exposing both REST and GraphQL endpoints to query Users (id, name), documented with Swagger/OpenAPI, backed by Prisma + SQLite, and secured with strict CORS (example.com-only).
- 🧮 MathQuiz + 🎯 Stroop Color Test [See➡️](https://github.com/IngAmaury/MathQuiz-StroopColor)
> A Python (Tkinter) desktop app that runs a short and auto-validated math quiz, then launches a timed Stroop Color task with image-based stimuli, a live countdown, and per-trial prompts (Spanish UI). 
- 🧠 EEG_UHB Library (Unicorn Hybrid Black + LSL) [See➡️](https://github.com/IngAmaury/EEG_UHB_LIBRARY)
> Python library packaged for distribution (pip-ready) to acquire EEG signals from Unicorn Hybrid Black using the LSL protocol, with a clean API for stream discovery, acquisition control, and data persistence    in csv files.
- 📝 Driver Study Questionnaires GUI (PyQt6) [See➡️](https://github.com/IngAmaury/Questionnaires)
> A PyQt6 desktop app for driving-simulator studies that guides participants through an initial battery + repeatable inter-stage blocks, and saves every response to an UTF-8 CSV (with scoring helpers like PSS    inverted items).
- 🤖 Emotion-Detection Chatbot (CNN + Streamlit) [See➡️](https://github.com/IngAmaury/chatbot)
> A Streamlit-based chatbot that detects emotions in text using CNN models. I built the models, trained them, and iterated improvements over time.
- 🔬 SIGIC — Scientific Information Management Platform (Full-stack) [See➡️](http://sigic-fn.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/)
> An interdisciplinary platform that helps research teams develop, process, and store scientific project results (built at IPN through multi-school collaboration). I contributed as a Full-Stack Developer; the codebase is in private repos (copyright/ownership), but I can share details or a walkthrough on request.
